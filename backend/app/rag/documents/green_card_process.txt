Employment-Based Green Card Process

Overview:
The employment-based green card (permanent residence) process allows foreign workers to obtain permanent residency in the United States through their employer. The most common categories for international students transitioning from H-1B are EB-2 and EB-3.

Employment-Based Categories:
1. EB-1: Priority Workers
   - EB-1A: Extraordinary Ability (self-petition possible)
   - EB-1B: Outstanding Professors and Researchers
   - EB-1C: Multinational Managers and Executives
   - Generally shorter wait times, no PERM required for EB-1A

2. EB-2: Advanced Degree Professionals
   - Requires master's degree or bachelor's + 5 years progressive experience
   - Requires PERM labor certification (in most cases)
   - EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver): Self-petition, no employer sponsorship needed

3. EB-3: Skilled Workers and Professionals
   - Requires bachelor's degree or 2+ years of experience
   - Requires PERM labor certification

The PERM Process (Labor Certification):
1. Employer conducts recruitment to test the US labor market
   - Must advertise the position and demonstrate no qualified US workers are available
   - Recruitment period: Typically 6-12 months
2. Employer files ETA Form 9089 with Department of Labor
3. DOL reviews and certifies (or audits)
4. Processing time: 6-18 months (can be longer if audited)

I-140 Petition (Immigrant Petition):
- Filed by employer after PERM is certified
- Establishes that the foreign worker qualifies for the EB category
- Processing time: 6-12 months (regular), 15 business days (premium processing)
- Approved I-140 locks in your priority date (your place in line)

I-485 Adjustment of Status (or Consular Processing):
- Final step to obtain green card
- Can only file when your priority date is current (visa number available)
- For India EB-2/EB-3: Wait can be 10-30+ years due to per-country limits
- For China EB-2/EB-3: Wait can be 4-8 years
- For Rest of World: Usually current or short wait

Per-Country Limits:
- Each country is limited to 7% of total employment-based green cards per year
- This creates massive backlogs for India and China
- Bills to eliminate per-country limits have been proposed but not yet passed

Important Timelines by Country (Approximate):
- India EB-1: 2-4 years
- India EB-2: 10-30+ years
- India EB-3: 10-25+ years
- China EB-1: 1-3 years
- China EB-2: 4-8 years
- China EB-3: 4-8 years
- Rest of World (all categories): Usually current to 2 years

AC21 Provisions (Maintaining Status During Long Waits):
- If I-140 is approved and PERM was filed 365+ days ago, H-1B can be extended beyond the 6-year limit
- This allows workers from backlogged countries to continue working while waiting
- H-1B extensions in 3-year increments until green card is available
- If I-485 has been pending for 180+ days, worker can change jobs (job portability)

Tips for International Students:
- Start the green card process as early as possible, especially if from India or China
- Consider EB-1 eligibility if you have strong publications, patents, or achievements
- EB-2 NIW does not require employer sponsorship and can be filed while on H-1B
- Keep all immigration documents organized — you'll need them for every step
- Maintain valid non-immigrant status throughout the entire process
