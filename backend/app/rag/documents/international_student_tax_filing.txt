International Student Tax Filing Guide (F-1 and J-1 Visa Holders)

Filing Requirement:
All F-1 and J-1 visa holders who were present in the United States during the tax year must file a federal tax return or information statement by April 15 of the following year. This applies regardless of whether you earned any income.

Form 8843 — Statement for Exempt Individuals:
- Required for ALL nonresident aliens present in the US, even if you had zero income
- This form establishes your exempt individual status under the Substantial Presence Test
- F-1 students and J-1 exchange visitors must file Form 8843 every year they are in the US
- If Form 8843 is the only form you need to file, mail it to the IRS in Austin, TX
- Spouses and dependents in F-2 or J-2 status must also file their own Form 8843

Form 1040-NR — Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return:
- Required if you are a nonresident alien who earned US-source income (wages, scholarships above tuition, stipends, etc.)
- Replaces the standard Form 1040 used by US citizens and residents
- Do NOT use Form 1040 or 1040-EZ if you are a nonresident alien
- You cannot file jointly with a spouse as a nonresident alien (unless making the Section 6013(g) election)
- Due date: April 15 (or June 15 if you had no wages subject to US withholding)

Nonresident Alien Status — The 5-Year Rule:
- F-1 students are considered nonresident aliens for federal tax purposes for their first 5 calendar years in the US
- J-1 students and researchers follow different rules (2 calendar years for students, varies for researchers)
- After 5 calendar years on F-1, you may become a resident alien under the Substantial Presence Test
- Resident aliens file Form 1040 (not 1040-NR) and are taxed on worldwide income
- The count is based on calendar years of presence, not total days (e.g., arriving December 31 counts as one year)

FICA Tax Exemption:
- F-1 students are EXEMPT from Social Security tax (6.2%) and Medicare tax (1.45%) for their first 5 calendar years in the US
- This exemption applies to on-campus employment, CPT, and OPT employment
- J-1 students are also exempt for their first 2 calendar years
- If your employer incorrectly withholds FICA taxes, you can request a refund using Form 843 and Form 8316
- After the exemption period ends, you must pay FICA taxes like any other worker

Tax Treaties:
Over 70 countries have income tax treaties with the United States that can reduce or eliminate tax on certain types of income for students and trainees. Common treaty benefits include:

- India: Up to $5,000 exemption on wages and personal services income under Article 21(d). Students and business apprentices can exclude $5,000 of income per year.
- China: Up to $5,000 exemption under Article 20(c) for students and business apprentices. Covers wages, salaries, and personal service income.
