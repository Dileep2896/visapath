Curricular Practical Training (CPT)

Overview:
Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is a type of work authorization available to F-1 students that allows employment as an integral part of an established curriculum. CPT can be either full-time or part-time and must be directly related to the student's major.

Eligibility:
- Must be in valid F-1 status
- Must have been enrolled full-time for at least one full academic year (exceptions for graduate students whose programs require immediate CPT)
- Employment must be an integral part of the curriculum (internship, cooperative education, practicum, etc.)
- Must be directly related to major area of study

Types of CPT:
1. Part-time CPT: 20 hours or less per week (does not affect OPT eligibility)
2. Full-time CPT: More than 20 hours per week (affects OPT if used for 12+ months)

Critical Rule — CPT and OPT Eligibility:
- If you use 12 months or more of FULL-TIME CPT, you become INELIGIBLE for post-completion OPT
- Part-time CPT does NOT count toward this limit
- This is cumulative across your entire F-1 status at the current education level

Application Process:
1. Receive a job offer related to your field of study
2. Confirm CPT is required or integral to your curriculum (may need faculty advisor letter)
3. Request CPT authorization from your DSO
4. DSO issues a new I-20 with CPT authorization on page 2
5. You may ONLY begin working after the CPT start date on your I-20

Important Rules:
- CPT must be authorized BEFORE you start working
- Working without CPT authorization is a violation of F-1 status
- CPT is employer-specific and location-specific
- If you change employers, you need new CPT authorization
- CPT is available only while you are enrolled in your program (not after completion)
- CPT authorization is typically granted for one semester at a time

Reporting:
- Report any changes to your DSO
- If CPT employment ends early, notify your DSO
- Maintain full-time enrollment while on part-time CPT
