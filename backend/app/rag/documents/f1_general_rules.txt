F-1 Student Visa — General Rules and Information

Overview:
The F-1 visa is the most common non-immigrant student visa for international students pursuing academic programs at SEVP-certified schools in the United States.

Maintaining F-1 Status:
- Enroll full-time each semester (exceptions for final semester, medical reasons with DSO approval)
- Make normal academic progress toward degree completion
- Do not work without proper authorization
- Keep passport valid at all times (at least 6 months validity recommended)
- Keep I-20 valid and up-to-date
- Report address changes to DSO within 10 days
- Do not remain in the US beyond the authorized stay

Employment Options for F-1 Students:
1. On-Campus Employment: Up to 20 hours/week during school, full-time during breaks
2. CPT (Curricular Practical Training): Must be integral to curriculum
3. OPT (Optional Practical Training): 12 months post-completion, 24-month STEM extension
4. Economic Hardship Employment: In cases of severe, unexpected financial difficulty
5. International Organization Employment: UN, World Bank, etc.

Duration of Status:
- F-1 students are admitted for "D/S" (Duration of Status)
- This means you are authorized to stay as long as you maintain valid F-1 status
- There is no specific expiration date on the I-94 (it shows "D/S")
- The visa stamp in your passport may expire, but you can remain in the US as long as your I-20 is valid

SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System):
- Your DSO manages your SEVIS record
- SEVIS fee must be paid before visa interview (I-901 fee: $350)
- SEVIS tracks your enrollment, employment, and program changes
- SEVIS record must be active to maintain F-1 status

Travel and Re-entry:
- You need a valid F-1 visa stamp to re-enter the US (except from Canada/Mexico for less than 30 days)
- Carry valid passport, valid I-20 (with travel signature within 6 months), and valid visa
- If your visa is expired, you must apply for a new one at a US consulate before returning
- If on OPT, carry EAD card and proof of employment

Transferring Schools:
- You can transfer to another SEVP-certified school
- Current DSO must transfer your SEVIS record to the new school
- Must enroll at the new school within 5 months of transfer
- Maintain valid F-1 status during the transfer process

Program Extension:
- If you cannot complete your program by the end date on your I-20, request an extension from your DSO
- Must request before I-20 expires
- Must demonstrate valid academic or medical reasons for the delay

Grace Periods:
- After program completion: 60 days to depart, transfer, or change status
- After OPT ends: 60 days
- If F-1 status is terminated: No grace period (must depart immediately or apply for reinstatement)

Common Violations (Avoid These!):
- Working without authorization
- Dropping below full-time enrollment without DSO approval
- Failing to report address changes
- Remaining in the US after I-20 expires without proper authorization
- Failing to report employment changes on OPT/STEM OPT
