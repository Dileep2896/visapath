H-1B Wage-Level Weighted Selection (FY 2027 and Beyond)

Overview:
Starting with fiscal year 2027 (registration period March 2026), USCIS will use a weighted selection system based on prevailing wage levels instead of a random lottery. This final rule was published by the Department of Homeland Security on December 29, 2025, and takes effect on February 27, 2026.

How It Works — Weighted Entries:
The new system assigns a number of "entries" to each H-1B registration based on the Department of Labor's Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) prevailing wage tier:
- Level I (entry-level / 17th percentile): 1 entry
- Level II (qualified / 34th percentile): 2 entries
- Level III (experienced / 50th percentile): 3 entries
- Level IV (fully competent / 67th percentile): 4 entries

More entries = higher probability of selection. This is NOT a guaranteed selection — it is still a random draw, but registrations with higher wage levels have proportionally more chances.

Selection Probability Impact:
Based on DHS analysis of recent registration data:
- Level I registrations: Selection probability reduced by approximately 48% compared to the old random lottery
- Level II registrations: Selection probability reduced by approximately 9%
- Level III registrations: Selection probability increased by approximately 40%
- Level IV registrations: Selection probability increased by approximately 107% (more than doubled)
- US Master's cap registrants still get two chances (first in the advanced degree pool, then in the regular cap)

Employer Registration Requirements:
During the electronic registration period, employers must now provide additional information:
- Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code for the position
- OEWS prevailing wage level (I through IV) for the position
- Area of intended employment (metropolitan or non-metropolitan statistical area)
- The offered wage must meet or exceed the prevailing wage for the stated SOC code and area

Integrity Measures:
- USCIS can deny or revoke an H-1B petition if the actual position details are inconsistent with the wage level claimed during registration
- If an employer submits multiple registrations for the same beneficiary at different wage levels, USCIS will use the lowest wage level to determine the number of entries
- Employers must certify that registration information is accurate and complete
- False or fraudulent registration information may result in denial, revocation, and potential debarment

Important Considerations for International Students:
- Entry-level positions (Level I wages) will be significantly harder to win in the lottery
- Students should negotiate for higher-level positions and wages to improve selection chances
- The wage level is determined by the DOL prevailing wage system based on job duties, requirements, and geographic area — not solely by the salary offered
- Students with advanced degrees (Master's or PhD) retain their dual-lottery advantage
- Cap-exempt employers (universities, research institutions, nonprofit research organizations) are NOT affected — they remain exempt from the cap and lottery

$100,000 Additional Filing Fee:
Since September 21, 2025, new H-1B petitions (not extensions or amendments) are subject to an additional $100,000 filing fee for employers with 25 or more full-time employees where more than 50% of employees are in H-1B or L-1 status. This fee is separate from the wage-level selection system.

Timeline:
- February 27, 2026: Final rule takes effect
- March 2026: First H-1B registration period under new wage-level weighted system (for FY 2027)
- October 1, 2026: First H-1B start date under new system (FY 2027)

Strategy Tips:
1. Aim for positions classified at Level III or IV wages for the best selection odds
2. Work with your employer and immigration attorney to ensure the SOC code and wage level accurately reflect the position
3. If you have multiple job offers, consider the wage level implications for H-1B selection
4. Continue to maintain valid F-1/OPT status as a backup while pursuing H-1B
5. Consider cap-exempt employers (universities, research orgs) to bypass the lottery entirely
