H-1B Specialty Occupation Visa

Overview:
The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US employers to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations requiring a bachelor's degree or higher. It is the most common pathway for international students to work in the US after their student status ends.

Annual Cap:
- Regular cap: 65,000 visas per fiscal year
- US Master's cap (advanced degree exemption): Additional 20,000 visas
- Cap-exempt employers (universities, research institutions, government research organizations) are NOT subject to the cap
- Fiscal year runs October 1 to September 30

H-1B Electronic Registration and Lottery:
- Employers must electronically register beneficiaries during the registration period (typically March 1-31)
- Registration fee: $215 per beneficiary (as of 2024)
- If registrations exceed the cap, USCIS conducts a lottery
- Lottery selection rate has been approximately 25-30% in recent years
- Selected registrants are notified, and employers have 90 days to file the full H-1B petition
- US Master's cap registrants get two chances: first in the advanced degree lottery, then in the regular cap lottery

Key Requirements:
- Job must qualify as a "specialty occupation" requiring at least a bachelor's degree
- Worker must have a bachelor's degree or higher (or equivalent) in a related field
- Employer must pay at least the prevailing wage for the position and location
- Employer must file a Labor Condition Application (LCA) with the Department of Labor

H-1B Petition Process:
1. Employer determines need for H-1B worker
2. Employer files Labor Condition Application (LCA) with DOL
3. Employer registers beneficiary during registration period
4. If selected in lottery, employer files Form I-129 with USCIS
5. USCIS adjudicates the petition
6. If approved, H-1B status begins October 1

Duration:
- Initial period: Up to 3 years
- Extension: Up to 3 additional years (6 years total)
- Beyond 6 years: Possible if I-140 has been approved or if PERM has been filed for 365+ days (AC21 provisions)

Cap-Gap Extension:
- If an F-1 student's OPT expires and they have a pending or approved H-1B petition for October 1 start:
- Their F-1 status and work authorization are automatically extended from April 1 to October 1
- This is called the "cap-gap" extension
- The cap-gap only applies if the H-1B petition is filed before OPT expires

Changing Employers (H-1B Transfer/Portability):
- H-1B workers can change employers
- New employer must file a new H-1B petition
- Worker can begin working for new employer as soon as the new petition is filed (portability)
- No need to wait for approval
- The transfer is NOT subject to the annual cap

FY 2027 Wage-Level Weighted Selection (Effective February 27, 2026):
- Starting FY 2027, USCIS replaces the random lottery with a wage-level weighted selection system
- Registrations are assigned 1-4 entries based on DOL prevailing wage level (Level I = 1 entry, Level IV = 4 entries)
- Higher wage levels have significantly better selection odds; Level I selection probability drops ~48%, Level IV increases ~107%
- Employers must provide SOC code, OEWS wage level, and area of employment during registration
- See the detailed document "H-1B Wage-Level Weighted Selection" for full details on the new system

Important Notes:
- H-1B is employer-specific — you can only work for the petitioning employer
- If you lose your job, you have a 60-day grace period to find a new employer or change status
- Premium processing ($2,805) is available for faster adjudication (15 business days)
- Spouse and children can apply for H-4 dependent status
- H-4 spouses may be eligible for work authorization (H-4 EAD) if the H-1B holder has an approved I-140
